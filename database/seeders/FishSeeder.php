To encourage breeding, mimic the dry and wet seasons: lower the water level, raise the temperature, and don’t feed them for a few weeks.', 'Notes' => 'So named because of the row of spots running along the lateral line, the porthole cat is a good community species. Newly imported fish tend to be a little delicate and are susceptible to disease. This is at least in part because all specimens sold for the trade are wild caught.

Areas of dense planting will also help. Gestation takes around 8 weeks and large broods of up to 120 fry are not uncommon. The adult fish will predate on the young so the best method of raising them is to remove the gravid female to a separate tank and allow her to give birth there before returning her to the main aquarium.

The fry are quite large and will accept brine shrimp nauplii or powdered flake from birth.', 'Notes' => 'A hugely popular aquarium fish. Many aquarium-bred colour morphs of this species are available, including the ubiquitous black molly. There are also Gold, Green, Lyretail, Silver and Dalmation varieties. Some of these are the results of P. sphenops being crossed with P. latipinna. The 2 species will also interbreed readily in the aquarium and in order to avoid this we suggest keeping only one of them per tank. There also exists a (in our opinion) grotesque ‘balloon’ variety of this fish in which the body is malformed and rounded, giving a balloon-like appearance. This condition can cause swimbladder and digestive problems and may bring about premature death.In the wild form this fish is very hardy but years of inbreeding and over-production have resulted in many of the mollies available in the hobby today being very weak genetically and prone to disease.'],

The spores (larval stage) of the parasite enter the fish through the mouth and burrow through the walls of the gut before settling in the muscles. There they produce cysts which cause rapid degeneration of the muscle tissue and development of the characteristic white patches.Once the disease takes hold mortality rates can rapidly become very high.

', 'Reproduction' => 'Firstly the male fertilizes the female with the gonopodium. The male inserts his sperms into the female. Unusually though, the females are able to save some sperms for later fertilization. The fry grow in the female where they consume the yolk stores. The female’s pregnancy can be identified by the dark body in front of the anal fin.Young swordtails are bigger than other fry of non live-bearer fishes. They immediately swim and can hide from predators. They also grow quickly and can eat flakes soon after birth.', 'Notes' => 'The swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) is a live-bearing freshwater fish. Its name comes from the male’s long, straight lower tail lobe, which resembles a pointed sword. The female has a rounded tail fin. This fish has a triangular head and conical upper and lower jaws. The male has a somewhat elongated body, while the female typically has a plumper abdomen.Ornamental fish breeders have developed over 50 unique strains of swordtail that come in a rainbow of colors and patterns.'],

Discus fish are egg layers and require specific conditions in order to breed.The breeding season for Discus fish is typically in the spring and summer months when the water temperature is warmer. You will need to provide your Discus fish with a separate breeding tank or area, as they will need privacy and protection from other fish.During the breeding process, the female Discus fish will lay eggs, and the male Discus fish will fertilise them. It is important to monitor the water quality during this time, as the eggs can be sensitive to changes in water parameters.', 'Notes' => 'Discus fish are beautiful and unique creatures that require specific care in order to thrive in captivity. These friendly and colourful fish have a reputation for being difficult to care for, but with the proper knowledge and attention to detail, they can be a rewarding addition to any aquarium.Discus fish are generally hardy and can live for many years if properly cared for. However, they are susceptible to certain health problems, such as bacterial and fungal infections, parasites, and injuries.It is important to monitor your Discus fish regularly for signs of illness, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and abnormal behaviour. If you notice any of these signs, you should isolate the affected fish and seek advice from a veterinarian or fish expert.'],

Females have straighter line of their dorsal , or top fin , to their eyes.', 'Reproduction' => 'Most Angels will reach sexual maturity at the age of 10-12 months, this is the approximate age when females lay eggs for the first time - and they are able to lay eggs once per month, however this statement can’t be taken as rule since fish often need a break after breeding constantly for a period that lasts 3-4 months for example. Females are able to lay eggs no matter whether there’s a male present in the tank or not, this prevents the females from becoming egg-bloated. As sexing Angelfish is impossible (males tend to grow larger than females though), fish will pair up naturally.Angelfish are about to spawn once the genital papillae appears, these organs are used for depositing and fertilizing eggs. A place where eggs are to be laid is cleaned 2-3 days prior to reproduction. Once the pair starts the process of reproduction, the female will lay start laying eggs on a plant (it can be a rock or even filter too) and the male will fertilize them.', 'Notes' => 'Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) are popular tropical freshwater aquarium fish, they are considered one of the most beautiful species of tropical freshwater aquarium fish. Angels often look outside their tank, they may react to various stimuli such as hands in an aquarium.
